Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        inline will not push anything around as far as the layout. block elements will they usually have a default height and width
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        it gets positioned based on the parent element not the entire viewport(screen)
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
      padding: 0;
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
      inline:
        1. <span>
        2. <img>
      block:
        1. <p>
        2. <h1>
        3. <ul>
      inline-block:
        1. <button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
        the box model is the idea that all the block level elements have several boxes that make up the total area and how the affect the elements around them.
        from the outside in you have
          margin > border > padding > content.
        the fix: border-sizing: border-box;
